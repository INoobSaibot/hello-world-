My name is Tobias Stecker, I live in Columbus Ohio. I have not started working in industry yet but I do aspire to get a job in software developement. For the last 2 years I have messed with Python 3.x a lot. I have done some small amounts of projecs in Java, Jave Script, C#, Unity 3D. I am getting used to working with Visuial Studio 2015, and Andorid Studio. I have deployed a game and a Hello World app to Android.

I am currently attending class and working towards a Software developer degree. I look forward to a pair programming event next month at Cover My Meds. link http://paircolumbus.org/
They seem to be very Ruby Rails -centric.

Thanks!
Toby
